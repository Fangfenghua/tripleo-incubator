VM (on Ubuntu)
==============

Overview:
* Setup a VM that is your bootstrap node
* Setup N VMs to pretend to be your cluster
* Go to town testing deployments on them.
* For troubleshooting see troubleshooting.md

Configuration
-------------

The bootstrap instance expects to run with its eth0 connected to the outside
world, via whatever IP range you choose to setup. You can run NAT, or not, as
you choose. This is how we connect to it to run scripts etc - though you can
equally log in on its console if you like.

As we have not yet brought quantum up, we're using flat networking, with a
single broadcast domain which all the bare metal machines are connected to.

According, the eth1 of your bootstrap instance should be connected to your bare
metal cloud LAN. The bootstrap VM uses the rfc5735 TEST-NET-1 range -
192.0.2.0/24 for bringing up nodes, and does its own DHCP etc, so do not
connect it to a network shared with other DHCP servers or the like. The
instructions in this document create a bridge device ('ooodemo') on your
machine to emulate this with virtual machine 'bare metal' nodes.

Detailed instructions
---------------------

* git checkout this repository to your local machine.

* Configure a network for your test environment.
  (This alters your /etc/network/interfaces file and adds an exclusion for
  dnsmasq so it doesn't listen on your test network.)

        sudo bootstrap/configure-baremetal-network -y

* Activate these changes (alternatively, restart):

        sudo ifup ooodemo
        sudo service libvirt-bin restart

* Create your bootstrap VM:

    sudo ubuntu-vm-builder kvm precise --rootsize=16384 --swapsize=0 -m 1024 \
      --proxy=$http_proxy --ssh-user-key=/home/robertc/.ssh/authorized_keys \
      --user=stack --name=stack --pass=stack -ai386 --hostname=bootstrap \
      --mirror=http://nz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu --domain= \
      --libvirt qemu:///system

 - Locate it in kvm - it will be called 'bootstrap', and then..
 - Create a second NIC for the virtual machine, telling it to use the ooodemo
   shared network device rather than the default NAT setup. This places eth1 of
   the virtual machine on your 'cloud' network.
 - install openssh if you like, do not install other network services such as DNS.
 - If you installed ssh you probably want to ssh-copy-id your ssh public key in
   at this point.
 - If you don't copy your SSH id in, you will still need to ensure that
   /home/stack/.ssh/authorized_keys on your bootstrap node has some kind of
   public SSH key in it
 - After the base installation, configure eth1 for communicating with your
   baremetal nodes - put this at the end of your /etc/network/interfaces. The
   iptables commands expose the metadata service needed by the nodes as they
   boot and permit baremetal nodes to access the rest of the world by routing
   via the bootstrap node (libvirt rejects traffic from unknown ip addresses,
   meaning that using the default libvirt nat environment requires the
   MASQUERADE for the bare metal nodes unless you reconfigure libvirt as well).
   Alternatively you can create a second dedicated bridge on your actual
   machine, put an ip address on it and configure eth0 in the bootstrap node
   manually or by manually configuring dnsmasq (or similar) on your machine
   to serve on that bridge.

            auto eth1
                iface eth1 inet static
                address 192.0.2.1
                netmask 255.255.255.0
                up iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 169.254.169.254 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8775
                up iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING  -s 192.0.2.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
                up ip addr add 192.0.2.33 dev eth1

* Create your 'baremetal' nodes.
 - using KVM create however many hardware notes your emulated cloud will have,
   ensuring that for each one you select ooodemo as the network device.
   - Give them no less than 1GB of disk each, we suggest 2GB.
   - 512MB of memory is probably enough.
   - Tell KVM you will install the virtual machine via PXE, as that will avoid
     asking you for a disk image or installation media.
   - A nice trick is to make one then to clone it N-1 times, after powering it
     off.
   - Specify the MAC address for each node. You need to feed this info
     to the populate-nova-bm-db.sh script later on.
   - Create 2 network cards for each VM: nova baremetal requires 2 NICs.

* Configure your bootstrap VM:
 - Setup a network proxy if you have one (e.g. 192.168.2.1 port 8080):

            echo << EOF >> ~/.profile
            export no_proxy=192.0.2.1
            export http_proxy=http://192.168.2.1:8080/
            EOF

* Prep bootstrap VM - do all this as the "stack" user:
 - install git
 
            sudo apt-get install git

 - clone our demo environment into /home/stack/demo

            cd ~
            git clone git://github.com/tripleo/demo.git

 - if you have varied from the defaults described here, edit the demo
   environment as needed (see localrc and scripts/defaults).

 - now make all the magic happen (this will use sudo, so don't just wander off
   and ignore it :))

            ~/demo/scripts/demo

 - Inform nova about your baremetal nodes

            scripts/populate-nova-bm-db.sh -i "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" -j "yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy" add

* if all goes well, you should be able to run this to start a node now:

        source ~/devstack/openrc
        # flavor 6 is i386, which will work on 64-bit hardware.
        # use 7 for amd64.
        nova boot --flavor 6 --image bare_metal --key_name default bmtest
