# NOTE: Copy this file to the root ``devstack`` directory for it to
# work properly.

# ``localrc`` is a user-maintained setings file that is sourced from ``stackrc``.
# This gives it the ability to override any variables set in ``stackrc``.
# Also, most of the settings in ``stack.sh`` are written to only be set if no
# value has already been set; this lets ``localrc`` effectively override the
# default values.

# This is a collection of some of the settings we have found to be useful
# in our DevStack development environments. Additional settings are described
# in http://devstack.org/localrc.html
# These should be considered as samples and are unsupported DevStack code.


# Minimal Contents
# ----------------

# While ``stack.sh`` is happy to run without ``localrc``, devlife is better when
# there are a few minimal variables set:

# If the ``*_PASSWORD`` variables are not set here you will be prompted to enter
# values for them by ``stack.sh`` and they will be added to ``localrc``.
ADMIN_PASSWORD=nomoresecrete
MYSQL_PASSWORD=stackdb
RABBIT_PASSWORD=stackqueue
SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
SERVICE_TOKEN=cde90da2fb9471d421ed

# Network Configuration
# ---------------------

# You probably need to change all the IPs here
HOST_IP=192.0.2.1
FIXED_NETWORK_SIZE=8
FIXED_RANGE=192.0.2.32/27
PUBLIC_INTERFACE=eth1

# Un-comment this if you want to test without the interwebs
# OFFLINE=True

# Repo changes

# Bare Metal customizations
# -------------------------
VIRT_DRIVER=baremetal

# if you need to add extra options to /etc/nova/nova.conf, and don't want to add
# them to the "BareMetal" section of stack.sh, put them here, one option per line.
# For example:
#
# EXTRA_OPTS=( \
# scheduler_default_filters=AllHostsFilter \
# )


# Logging
# -------

# By default ``stack.sh`` output only goes to the terminal where it runs.  It can
# be configured to additionally log to a file by setting ``LOGFILE`` to the full
# path of the destination log file.  A timestamp will be appended to the given name.
LOGFILE=$DEST/logs/stack.sh.log

# Old log files are automatically removed after 7 days to keep things neat.  Change
# the number of days by setting ``LOGDAYS``.
LOGDAYS=2

export OS_NO_CACHE=True

# Swift
# -----

# Swift is now used as the back-end for the S3-like object store. If Nova's
# objectstore (``n-obj`` in ``ENABLED_SERVICES``) is enabled, it will NOT
# run if Swift is enabled. Setting the hash value is required and you will
# be prompted for it if Swift is enabled so just set it to something already:
SWIFT_HASH=66a3d6b56c1f479c8b4e70ab5c2000f5

# For development purposes the default of 3 replicas is usually not required.
# Set this to 1 to save some resources:
SWIFT_REPLICAS=1

# The data for Swift is stored in the source tree by default (``$DEST/swift/data``)
# and can be moved by setting ``SWIFT_DATA_DIR``. The directory will be created
# if it does not exist.
SWIFT_DATA_DIR=$DEST/data
